# OpenPages
a script that will capture the URL for every open web page in Chrome and Edge, save those into a list in a text document on my desktop titled "Open Web Pages" and then close down all browser windows. The list should have a datetime stamp at the top and, if the document already exists on my desktop, the new list will append to the previous contents.

This was created using ChatGPT in the standard Chat, trying things out.
